- title: Postdoctoral Research Associate, Princeton University / NOAA GFDL, Princeton
  from: March 2023
  to: May 2025
  description: (1) Designed and developed a plume injection scheme for biomass burning
               emissions in GFDLâ€™s AM4 and implemented the scheme into the aerosol module
               to study the decadal impact of plume injection height from wildfires
               on coupled climate modeling systems.
               (2) Implemented the plume injection scheme to AM4.1 full chemistry and analyzed
               the ENSO-driven variability of ozone sources (biomass burning, lightning NOx, 
               stratospheric exchange, etc.) on tropospheric ozone radiative forcing
               (3) Developed and implemented interactive fire emissions and injection in
               GFDL's ESM4.5 coupling emissions from dynamic fire in LM4.2 to atmospheric
               chemistry and aerosols in AM4.5

  from: August 2022
  to: February 2023
  description: (1) Introduced a novel approach for investigating aerosol-cloud interaction
               using data assimilation and spectral bin method for microphysics. Designed
               the forward operator for NEXRAD radar assimilation. Designed a 3DVAR 
               framework for the application of radar data assimilation.

  from: June 2018
  to: August 2022
  description: (1) Introduced a novel Lagrangian model, C-TRAIL v1.0,
               providing an alternative method for simulating atmospheric
               diffusion through incorporation in an Eulerian air quality model.
               (2) Developed a physically accurate sub-grid cloud convection module
               based on a meteorological approach for accurate quantification of vertical
               and long-range transport in CMAQ air quality modeling.
               (3) Developed Forward Operator for OMI HCHO/NO2 and implemented them in
               the WRF-Chem/DART framework, to study wildfire-related ozone formation
               during the 2019 FIREX-AQ campaign.
