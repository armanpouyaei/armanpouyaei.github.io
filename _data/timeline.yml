  to: 2022
  description: (1) Introduced a novel Lagrangian model, C-TRAIL v1.0,
               providing an alternative method for simulating atmospheric
               diffusion through incorporation in an Eulerian air quality model.
               (2) Developed a physically accurate sub-grid cloud convection module
               based on a meteorological approach for accurate quantification of vertical
               and long-range transport in CMAQ air quality modeling.
               (3) Developed Forward Operator for OMI HCHO/NO2 and implemented them in
               the WRF-Chem/DART framework, to study wildfire-related ozone formation
               during the 2019 FIREX-AQ campaign.

  from: 2022
  to: 2023
  description: (1) Introduced a novel approach for investigating aerosol-cloud interaction
               using data assimilation and spectral bin method for microphysics. Designed
               the forward operator for NEXRAD radar assimilation. Designed a 3DVAR 
               framework for the application of radar data assimilation.

  from: 2023
  to: present
  description: (1) Designed and developed a plume injection scheme for biomass burning
               emissions in GFDLâ€™s CM4 and implemented the scheme into the aerosol module
               to study the decadal impact of plume injection height from wildfires
               on coupled climate modeling systems.
